## Code Blocks

### Inline Code

Functional interfaces in Java can be annotated with `@FunctionalInterface` and if
the interface contains only one `abstract` method, the code will compile.

### Fenced Code Blocks

My first Java program:

```java
    public class Test {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello World!");
  }
}
```

## Blockquotes

> "Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will
> spend the first four sharpening the axe."
>
> "You can fool all the people some of the time,
> and some of the people all the time,
> but you can't fool all the people all the time."
>
> > Abraham Lincoln (1809-1865).
